## tears ðŸ˜­
+ **\*\*\*\* transitions and fades. Never again.**
+ Buttons remain clickable during fade in/out, causes problems
+ No logic for draws


## best beans ðŸ¦„
+ **fades and transitions** love/hate relationship I guess


## how you check for wins ðŸŒš
+ function for rowWin, columnWin, diagonalWin using for loops and div indexOf


## how I'd re-make
+ **No more fades** .... ~~no~~ more fades? Maybe more fades.
+ Features for tracking scores, more clear whose turn it is.
